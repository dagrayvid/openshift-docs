Many applications require specialized hardware or software which depend on kernel modules or drivers. The recommended approach to load out-of-tree kernel modules on {op-system-first} nodes is to use driver containers. To deploy out-of-tree drivers at the same time as cluster installation (day-1) the kmods-via-containers framework can be used. For loading drivers or kernel modules on an existing {product-title} cluster (day-2) {product-title} offers several tools:

* The Driver Toolkit is a container image which is a part of every OpenShift release. It contains the kernel packages and other common dependencies needed for building a driver or kernel module. The Driver Toolkit can be used as a base image for driver container image builds on the {product-title}.
* The Special Resource Operator (SRO) orchestrates the building and management of driver containers for loading kernel modules and drivers on an existing (day 2) OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.
* The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator for adding node labels for CPU capabilities, kernel version, PCIe device vendor IDs, and more.
